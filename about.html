<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jason Hunter. Welcome to my portfolio page!</p>

<p>Since this page is about me, I may as well tell you more about me. I'm 41, live in Cincinnati, OH. I'm engaged to my
wonderful fiance, Jamie, who is also the mother to our two children, Isaiah (8) and Zoe (6). I've been involved in IT for
some time, in one capacity or another. I've earned both a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and a Master's Degree in Business
Administration. I coach both basketball and football, and have been doing so for almost 20 years. We also own a yorkie named Stella.
I want a big dog, but we need to build a fence for it.

<p>This is a little long-winded. If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to reach out and ask.</p>
